# Scanning-using-OWASP-ZAP-and-Burp Suite


For my cybersecurity project, I selected testphp.vulnweb.com to perform vulnerability assessments using OWASP ZAP and Burp Suite. Initially, I conducted an automated scan with ZAP to identify vulnerabilities and generated a detailed HTML report. Then, I manually verified these vulnerabilities using Burp Suite, performed a thorough manual scan, and generated a second report. Finally, I compared the reports from both tools to ensure comprehensive vulnerability detection and assessment.
